<p>
     Notes on JS features from ES5 to ES6 and some ES3. Note that there was no ES4.
</p>

<span class="subtitle"> Semi colons</span>
<p>
Semi colons are optional. Gotchas to watch out for:
    <span class ="code">
        return
            1;
    </span>
    returns undefined because of the line break.
    <span class ="code">
        var f = () => ({x:2})
        f
        ({x:1}).x
    </span>
    evaluates to 2.

    I prefer to omit semi-colons.
</p>

<span class="subtitle"> Object creation</span>
    <p>
        Literal - prototype defaults to Object: <span class ="code-inline">{}.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Function constructor - prototype defaults to Object if not set.
        <span class ="code">
            function F() { this.prototype = ...}
            new F()
        </span>
        or set the prototype as  <span class ="code-inline"> F.prototype = ... </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        ES5 creation: <span class ="code-inline">
            Object.create(prototype, propertyDescriptors).
        </span>
        When prototype is null then the new object's prototype is undefined.
    </p>


<span class="subtitle"> Equals </span>
<p>
    <span class ="code-inline">==</span> performs a type conversion. <span class ="code-inline">===</span> is stricter and returns false for all values with different types.
</p>

<span class="subtitle"> Object methods </span>
<p>
    <span class ="code-inline">valueOf</span> is used in string conversions i.e.
    <span class ="code-inline">
        '' + x
    </span>
    is like
    <span class ="code-inline">
        x.valueOf().toString().
    </span>
    <span class ="code-inline">toString</span> defaults to
    <span class ="code-inline">[object classname]</span> where classname is an internal property of the runtime but can be used
    to extract the class of an object i.e.
    <span class ="code-inline">
        Object.prototype.toString.call(o).
    </span>

    <span class ="code-inline">toJson</span>
     is used when serialising object to strings i.e.
    <span class ="code-inline">
        JSON.stringify(v)
    </span>
    is like
    <span class ="code-inline">
    JSON.stringify(v.toJson()).
    </span>

    and defaults to identity.

    <span class ="code-inline">call</span> invokes a function with specific binding to this and remaining arguments.

    <span class ="code-inline">apply</span> is like call but takes its arguments as an array.

    e.g. useful to flatten an array of arrays:
    <span class ="code">
        Array.prototype.concat.apply([], [[1,2], [3,4]])
    </span>
    returns <span class ="code-inline">[1,2,3,4]</span>.
    <span class ="code-inline">bind</span> returns a new function with partially applied arguments.
    Its first argument is <span class ="code-inline">this</span>. This is like currying in functional programming.
</p>

<span class="subtitle"> Object properties </span>
<p>
    An object is a dynamic set of key/value properties with unique keys.
    Set a property <span class ="code-inline">p</span> on <span class ="code-inline">o</span> to value <span class ="code-inline">v</span>:
    <span class ="code-inline">
        o.p = v
    </span>
    or
    <span class ="code-inline">
        o[p] = v.
    </span>
    Values are a primitive datatype or a function type - if the latter then it is a method of <span class ="code-inline">o.</span>
</p>

<span class="subtitle"> Types</span>
<p>
    The JS primitive types are:
    <span class ="code-inline">
        number,
    </span>
    <span class ="code-inline">
        string,
    </span>
    <span class ="code-inline">
        boolean.
    </span>

    All non-primitive object have type:
    <span class ="code-inline">
    object.
    </span>
    The type of undefined is
    <span class ="code-inline">
    undefined.
    </span>
</p>


<span class="subtitle"> Arrays</span>
<p>
    An array is created as a literal <span class ="code-inline">[]</span> or with <span class ="code-inline">new Array()</span>.
    An array-like object has a non-enumerable length property and enumerable numeric keys >= 0 and <= Infinity.
    Such an object can be handled as an array but won't offer random access times expected from a real array.

    Array methods <span class ="code-inline">push</span>, <span class ="code-inline">pop</span>, <span class ="code-inline">shift</span>,
    <span class="code-inline">unshift</span> maintain the length property.

    An array like object can be converted to an array using:

    <span class ="code">
        Array.prototype.slice.call({0:1, 1:2,length:2})
    </span>

    A sparse array literal with commas is filled with undefined values:
    <span class ="code-inline">
        [,,,]
    </span>
</p>

<span class="subtitle"> Inheritance </span>
<p>
    JS has prototype based inheritence.

    An object's prototype can be accessed via the non-standard property,
    <span class ="code-inline">
        __prototype__
    </span>.

    This property is set by the runtime as defined above during object creation.

    A property access on an object traverses its prototype chain returning the first matching property.

    An overriden property overshadows any property with the same name in the prototype chain.

    Adding or removing a property on the prototype (which may be shared with many objects)
    affects all the objects which inherit from the prototype.
</p>

<span class="subtitle"> this </span>
<p>
    <span class ="code-inline">this</span> is a keyword in a function scope, not a variable.
    Its value is dynamic and depends on the invocation context and whether strict mode is enabled.

    In an object function constructor - this refers to the newly created object.

    In a top level function this refers to the global object in non strict mode or is undefined in strict mode.

    In a method - this refers to the object on which the method is a property.

    Since this is not a variable - it is not captured by a closure and must be assigned to a new variable e.g self - in order to be captured.
</p>

<span class="subtitle"> arguments </span>
<p>
    <span class ="code-inline">arguments</span> is a keyword inside a function body that represents an array-like object for the function arguments.
</p>

<span class="subtitle"> Property access control in ES5. </span>
<p>
    A property's descriptor has 3 boolean valued attributes for access control:

    <span class ="code-inline">
        writable
    </span>
    i.e. is it not readonly. An Object with a get method and without a set method is readonly by default.

    <span class ="code-inline">
        enumerable
    </span>
    i.e. is the property returned by
    <span class ="code-inline">
        Object.keys
    </span>
    and iterable in a for loop.
    <span class ="code-inline">
        configurable
    </span>
    i.e. can it be deleted.

    <span class ="code-inline">
        Object.preventExtensions(o)
    </span>
    prevents new properties being added to <span class ="code-inline">o</span>.

    <span class ="code-inline">
        Object.seal()
    </span>
    is as <span class ="code-inline">preventExtensions,</span> but also prevents property deletion and further configuration.
    Properties are still writable.

    <span class ="code-inline">
        Object.freeze(o)
    </span>

    is as <span class ="code-inline">seal,</span> but also makes all properties read only.
</p>

<span class="subtitle"> Property membership testing. </span>
<p>
    <span class ="code-inline">
        'propertyName' in o
    </span>

    - does <span class ="code-inline">o</span> have an own or inhertited property <span class ="code-inline">'propertyName'</span>?

    <span class ="code-inline">
        o.hasOwnProperty('propertyName')
    </span>

    - does <span class ="code-inline">o</span> have an own property <span class ="code-inline">'propertyName'</span>?

    <span class ="code-inline">
        o.propetyIsEnumerable('propertyName')
    </span>
    - is the property returned in <span class ="code-inline">Object.keys</span> and iterable in a <span class ="code-inline">for of</span> loop.

    <span class ="code-inline">
        o.p !== undefined
    </span>

    - <span class ="code-inline">o </span> may or not have a property <span class ="code-inline">p</span>.

</p>

<span class="subtitle"> Scope </span>
<p>
    ES3 has function scope, not block scope. Furthermore, variable declarations are "hoisted" to the top of a scope.
    i.e. If a variable is used before it is declared then that's okay!
    Each function scope introduces a new scope on the stack with normal shadowing rules.

    ES5 introduced familiar block scope through let bindings. e.g.

    <span class ="code">
        let( x = v) {
            ...
        }
    </span>
</p>

<span class="subtitle"> Creating a final object in ES5? </span>
<p>
    Set a null prototype and freeze all properties - perhaps something like this:
    <span class ="code">
        Object.freeze(Object.assign(Object.create(null), {x:1}))
    </span>

</p>

<span class="subtitle"> Promise (ES5). </span>
<p>
    Promise is a monad like object for writing asynchronous code that avoids callback hell.

    Its constructor takes a higher order function with parameters resolve, reject and error functions.

    e.g. this code starts running a new promise that resolves to a string value after 0.5 seconds.
    <span class ="code">
        new Promise(resolve => {
            setTimeout(() => resolve('timed out!'), 500)
        })
    </span>

    We can capture the timeout event with a callback on the promise:

    <span class ="code">
        new Promise(resolve => {
            setTimeout(() => resolve('timed out!'), 500)
        }).then (console.log)
    </span>

    Exceptions thrown during the evaluation of the promise or rejections, can be caught with the catch callback:

    <span class ="code">
        new Promise(resolve => {
            setTimeout(() => resolve('timed out!'), 500)
        }).then (console.log)
          .catch (console.error)
    </span>

    Recall that the monad's bind function looks like this

    <span class ="code">
        Ma -> a -> Mb -> Mb
    </span>

    The <span class ="code-inline"> Promise.then </span> method follows this pattern, which has type

    <span class ="code">
        a -> Mb
    </span>

    as it may return a new <span class ="code-inline">Promise</span> that resolves to a new value. This is called a chain of promises.

    <span class ="code-inline">
        Promise.all
    </span>
    takes a list of promises which resolves when all promises resolve in parallel.

    <span class ="code-inline">
        Promise.resolve
    </span>
    returns a promise that is immediately resolved.
</p>

<span class="subtitle"> Closures. </span>
<p>

    The free variables in a function scope are closed under the lexical scope
    (i.e. the syntactic position of the function).
    Free variables are the variables in the function body which are not in the bound variables, which are the functions list of formal parameters.

    <span class ="code-inline">this</span> inside an ES5 Fat arrow function is bound at the point of declaration and cannot be changed - contrasting with an ES3 function declaration.
</p>

<span class="subtitle"> Iterable protocol (ES5). </span>
<p>
    An object can appear in a for of loop when it implements the iterable protocol:

    <span class ="code">
        let c = {
            [Symbol.iterable]() {
                let start = 0
                return {
                    next()  {
                        return {
                            value: start++,
                            done: start > 10
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    </span>

    <span class ="code-inline">
        for (let i of c) console.log(i)
    </span> logs 0 to 9.
</p>

<span class="subtitle"> Generators (ES5). </span>
<p>
    A generator function yields many values:
    <span class ="code">
        function * values() {
            yield 1
            yield * [2,3,4]
        }
    </span>
    and can be used in a for of statement:
    <span class ="code">
        for (let v of values()) console.log(v)
    </span>

    logs 1 2 3 and 4

    Class method generator:

    <span class ="code">
        class C  {
            * values() { }
        }
    </span>

    Object literal method generator:

    <span class ="code">
        {
            * values() { }
        }
    </span>


    A generator implements the iterable protocol:

    <span class ="code">
        let g = values()
        g.next() // {value: 1, done: false}
        g.next() // {value: 2, done: false}
    </span>

    The consumer can feedback to the generator by passing a value to next:

    <span class ="code">
        g.next('hi')
    </span>

    and inside the generator this value is picked up:

    <span class ="code">
        let message = yield
        console.log(message) // hi
    </span>

    Generators are used to model asynchronous control flow without callbacks.

    Note that the generator yields control to the consumer and is resumed when the consumer calls next on the generator.

    So the idea is for the generator to yield a promise, which
    when resolved, the consumer passes the resolved value back to the generator with next - relinquishing control
    to the generator with the result.

    So the generator is where you may wait on an asynchronous value without blocking.
    The consumer in this case is just a utility method that captures the promises' happy path.

    e.g. using whatwg fetch:
    <span class ="code">
        function async(promiseIterator) {
            let promises = promiseIterator()
            let consume = lastResolvedValue => {
                let promise = promises.next(lastResolvedValue)
                if (!promise.done) {
                    promise.value.then(consume)
                }
            }
            consume()
        }

        async(function* () {
            let data = yield fetch('/')
            data.text().then(console.log)
        })
    </span>

</p>

<span class="subtitle"> Global object. </span>
<p>
    <span class ="code-inline">window</span> is the global object on client side JS.
</p>

<span class="subtitle"> Strict mode. </span>
<p>
    A single line at the start of a function body or block:
    <span class ="code-inline">
        'use strict';
    </span>
    enables strict mode.

    This will e.g. enable more <span class ="code-inline">ReferenceErrors</span> and <span class ="code-inline">TypeErrors</span> at runtime and
    disallow constructs such as <span class ="code-inline">with</span> expressions.
    <span class ="code-inline">this</span> inside a function body is never bound to the global object in strict mode.
</p>
