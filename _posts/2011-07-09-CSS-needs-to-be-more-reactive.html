<p>
    Binding is a common problem for interactive programming. Every programming language seems to have its own solution for reactivity.
    For a long time the observer pattern which is based on the publish/subscribe principle has been the status quo.
    These days though, even Flex features declarative bindings and JavaFX uses data flow dependencies to trigger reactions.
</p>
<p>
    Functional reactive programming (FRP) is based on signal processing and modelling continuous events. Flapjax, the <a href="http://www.flapjax-lang.org">JavaScript API</a>,
    and also, <a href="http://lamp.epfl.ch/~imaier/"> scala.react</a> the embedded DSL for Scala, have event streams as first class values.
    Meanwhile, Rx a.k.a Linq to events isn't FRP but has a novel take on duality between Observer and Iterator patterns which are
    coined as push (by producer) and pull (by consumer). See <a href="http://csl.stanford.edu/~christos/pldi2010.fit/meijer.duality.pdf">this</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The idea of FRP seems to be to convert a raw event stream, i.e values over time, into a dynamic behaviour, with dataflow dependencies
    thrown in, to respond to events without resorting to the inversion of control - a.k.a - the observer pattern.
    See also Scala's actor model for reactive programming without shared memory and without inversion of control.
<p>
    CSS 2.1 has dynamic pseudo-classes such as <span class="code-inline">:hover</span>, <span class="code-inline">:active</span> and
    <span class="code-inline">:focus</span>. These pseudo classes add a little reactivity to CSS.
</p>
<p>
    A common pattern with JQuery/ JavaScript is binding the events from one DOM element to a dynamic behaviour of another DOM element.
    For example, this fragment of JQuery code binds the hover events received from on a source to a dynamic style on the target:
</p>
    <div class="code" style="width:500px;">
    var overAndOut = function(){$("#target").toggleClass("dynamic-style")};
        </div>
        <div class="code" style="width:500px;">
    $("#source").hover(overAndOut, overAndOut)
    </div>
<p>
    The effect is the target receives the dynamic class-style while the user hovers over the source.

    Here's an application of this pattern with a classical list menu - below on the left.
</p>

      <div id="menu-bar-demo">
            <div id="menublock-demo">
                <div id="m_li1">

                </div>
                <div id="m_li2">

                </div>
                <div id="m_li3">

                </div>
                <div id="m_li4">

                </div>
            </div>
            <ul id="menu-demo">
                <li id="li1">
                    <a>iPhone</a>
                </li>
                <li id="li2">
                    <a>Pencil Sharpening</a>
                </li>
                <li id="li3">
                    <a>Gallery</a>
                </li>
                <li id="li4">
                    <a>Frisbee</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>


<p>
    There isn't really a way to implement this menu with only CSS without JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
    CSS seems to be already primed for this kind of binding, using the descendant selector.
    This is a common pattern in coding CSS menus and looks more or less like this:

    <div class="code">#source :hover #target .dynamic-style</div>
</p>
<p>
    The problem is that in the example menu above, the targets aren't descendants of the sources.
    But what about CSS 3.0 sibling selectors for adjacent and general siblings?
    The problem with that is targets that need to be selected occur before the sources in the document. The sibling selectors are limited to
    matching following elements and cannot match preceding siblings. The general sibling selector isn't general enough.
</p>
<p>
    So okay, we already know CSS selectors do not have a parent or a previous-sibling selector, like XPath has the parent and previous-sibling axes.
    But, why not allow full connectivity between DOM nodes with CSS selectors when dynamic pseudo-classes are needed?
   CSS selectors are limited to forwards-only selection - that is - forwards in the document-order.
   This is great for stream processing the webpage in a single pass over the stream
   while the page is being loaded. But it is bad news for the needs of dynamic behaviour after the page has loaded.
</p>
<p>
   CSS could be extended with new operators for the parent and previous sibling selectors without interfering too much with the existing syntax.
   Perhaps the symbols <span class="code-inline">^</span> and <span class="code-inline"><-</span> could be used for parent and previous sibling selectors, respectively.
   Then, to maintain fast page-loading times, these selectors are only effective after a dynamic pseudo-class has been applied. For example, something like this:
    <div class="code">
        #source :hover <- #target .dynamic-style
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    I think a worthwhile research idea is to design the core of a purely declarative language for CSS,
    which incorporates all the necessary features for GUI programming.
    Part of the problem is that the scope isn't yet well-defined, so a benchmark of lots of examples would help. Perhaps timed CCS could be a starting point for more reactive style sheets.
