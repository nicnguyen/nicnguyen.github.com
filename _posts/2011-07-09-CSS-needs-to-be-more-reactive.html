    Binding is such a common pattern in GUI programming that every language has its own solution.
</p>
<p>
    Declarative binding is obviously very appealing and
    functional reactive programming looks like a very cool technique. Flapjax, the <a href="http://www.flapjax-lang.org">JavaScript API</a>,
    and also, <a href="http://lamp.epfl.ch/~imaier/"> scala.react</a> the embedded DSL for Scala, both provide event streams as first class values.
</p>
<p>
    Basically, the idea seems to be to convert a raw event stream into a dynamic behaviour, with dataflow dependencies
    thrown into the mix.
<p>
    Anyway, CSS 2.1 already has dynamic pseudo-classes such as <span class="code-inline">:hover</span>, <span class="code-inline">:active</span> and
    <span class="code-inline">:focus</span>. So why not step it up a level?
    Dynamic pseudo-classes have already started a trend of replacing Javascript with declarative CSS.
    I hope that trend will continue, so that one day, client-side Javascript will be unnecessary.
</p>
<p>
    A common pattern with JQuery/ JavaScript is binding the events from one DOM element to a dynamic behaviour of another DOM element.
    For example, this fragment of JQuery code binds the hover events received from on a source to a dynamic style on the target:
</p>
    <div class="code" style="width:500px;">
    var overAndOut = function(){$("#target").toggleClass("dynamic-style")};
        </div>
        <div class="code" style="width:500px;">
    $("#source").hover(overAndOut, overAndOut)
    </div>
<p>
    The effect is the target receives the dynamic class-style while the user hovers over the source.

    Here's an application of this pattern with a classical list menu - below on the left.
</p>

      <div id="menu-bar-demo">
            <div id="menublock-demo">
                <div id="m_li1">

                </div>
                <div id="m_li2">

                </div>
                <div id="m_li3">

                </div>
                <div id="m_li4">

                </div>
            </div>
            <ul id="menu-demo">
                <li id="li1">
                    <a>iPhone</a>
                </li>
                <li id="li2">
                    <a>Pencil Sharpening</a>
                </li>
                <li id="li3">
                    <a>Gallery</a>
                </li>
                <li id="li4">
                    <a>Frisbee</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>


<p>
    There is no way to implement this menu today with pure CSS and without JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
    CSS seems to be already primed for this kind of binding, using the descendant selector.
    This is a common pattern in coding CSS menus and looks more or less like this:

    <div class="code">#source :hover #target .dynamic-style</div>
</p>
<p>
    The problem, though, is that in the example menu above, the targets aren't descendants of the sources.
    But what about CSS 3.0 sibling selectors for adjacent and general siblings?
    The problem with that is targets that need to be selected occur before the sources in the document. The sibling selectors are limited to
    matching following elements and cannot match preceding siblings. The general sibling selector isn't general enough.
</p>
<p>
    We already know CSS selectors do not have a parent or a previous-sibling selector, like XPath has the parent and previous-sibling axes.
    But, why not allow full connectivity between DOM nodes with CSS selectors when dynamic pseudo-classes are needed?
   CSS selectors are limited to forwards-only selection - that is - forwards in the document-order.
   This is great for stream processing the webpage in a single pass over the stream
   while the page is being loaded. But it is bad news for the needs of dynamic behaviour after the page has loaded.
</p>
<p>
   CSS can certainly be extended with new operators for the parent and previous sibling selectors without interfering with the existing syntax.
   Perhaps the symbols <span class="code-inline">^</span> and <span class="code-inline"><-</span> could be used for parent and previous sibling selectors, respectively.
   Then, to maintain fast page-loading times, these selectors are only effective after a dynamic pseudo-class has been applied. For example, something like this:
    <div class="code">
        #source :hover <- #target .dynamic-style
    </div>
</p>
<p>
    In general, adding new features to a language, retrospectively, is not the ideal way to design a language.

    So perhaps, a research idea is to design the core of a purely declarative language for CSS,
    which incorporates all the necessary features for GUI programming, including binding behaviours to events, data flow, styling, state machines.
    The scope isn't well-defined yet, so a benchmark of use cases would help.
