title: SPath

<p>
SPath is an extensible framework for defining embedded, XPath-like query languages in Scala.
Extensibility is supported in two directions. Firstly the axis-relations are extensible.
Second, SPath is extensible over the domain of the data being queried.
Being able to define new axis-relations as functions enables programmers to specialise node-relations.
Being extensible over the domain of the node types of the data means that the language can be reused for
any kind of tree data-structure that has been implemented with the composite design-pattern. What this means, specifically,
is that SPath needs to know, simply the child-relation and sibling-order of your trees.
</p>

<p>
The SPath framework has extensions for the GUI toolkits, Swing and SWT, and the XML APIs, org.w3c.dom.Node and scala.xml.Node.
Other extensions are equally viable, such as for JSON or YAML.

If you are interested in using SPath for other types of semi-structured data,
or are interested in further developments on core SPath, or implementing SPath in another languauge, such as Ruby,
then please get in touch to discuss your interests. I would be happy to hear from you.
