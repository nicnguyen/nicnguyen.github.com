<p>
SPath is an extensible framework for defining XPath-like query languages in Scala with an internal domain-specific language.
Extensibility is supported in three directions. Firstly the axis-relations are extensible (an axis defines a relation between document-tree nodes).
Second, SPath is extensible over the domain of the data being queried.
Thirdly, the vocabulary of the DSL can be extended thanks to Scala's implicit conversions.
Being able to define new axis-relations as functions enables programmers to write queries with domain-specific axes.
Being extensible over the domain of the node types of the data means that the language can be reused for
any kind of tree data-structure that has been implemented with the composite design-pattern. Specifically,
SPath needs to know about the child-relation and sibling-order of its document trees.

The SPath framework has extensions for the GUI toolkit, Swing, and the XML APIs, org.w3c.dom.Node and scala.xml.Node.
Other extensions are possible, such as for JSON or YAML.
