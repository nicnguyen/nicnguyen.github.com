<p>
NOXML is my project for alternative processing tools for XML and ideally, related data formats such as JSON, YAML and so on and so forth.
My embedded domain specific language, called SPath, shows that it is not hard to implement a better query language for XML in Scala - a
nice object oriented and functional programming language with strong typing enforced at compile time.

In future I want to implement SPath on succinct XML data structures.
