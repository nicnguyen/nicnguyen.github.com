<p>
DharmaVis is where Dharma and Information Visualization meet. Dharma, the teachings of Buddha, is rich with technical relationships.

Dharma-technology has sometimes been illustrated, visually, to communicate simply the meaning of Dharma.

One such example is the wheel of life. Buddha created the diagram of the wheel of life to illustrate the twelve dependent-related links, within the cycle of samsara.

Nowadays, computers and their user interfaces have contributed interaction to the practice of information visualization.

A goal of information visualization is to trigger an Aha! moment within the user's mind.

This Aha! moment is when the user gains insight into previously obscured information through a beautifully designed visualization.

I believe that modern information visualization might be able to support the goals of meditation, too. The ultimate Aha! moment for the meditator is enlightenment.

The goal of this project is to collect a gallery of information visualizations for Dharma.

If you have an idea for a new contribution to this gallery then please get in touch with me and we can make it happen.
