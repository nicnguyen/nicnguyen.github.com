FRP? Rx? Angular? Actors? I'm working on a framework for programming UI with state machines. A couple my previous posts describe the current state and history of this work for
    <a href="{{site.host}}/2014/02/20/javascript-state-machines.html">JavaScript</a>, <a href="{{site.host}}/2011/07/09/CSS-needs-to-be-more-reactive.html">CSS</a> and

The general idea is to program user interfaces with state machines (A.K.A finite automata, B&uuml;chi automata, graphs). However, my latest framework let's the programmer define the machines
with a DSL which is like regular expressions. Actually I'm using LTL but regular expressions would be a general improvement for the framework.

Regular expression have been used to define communication processes in the Esterel programming language. Why not rediscover what they can do for UI programming?
