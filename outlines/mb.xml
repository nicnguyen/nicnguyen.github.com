        <section title="What is Emptiness?">
            Emptiness is the way things really are. It is the way things exist as opposed the the way they appear.
        </section>


        <section title="The Emptiness of our Body">
        <p>
        There are two ways of searching for an object - conventional search and ultimate search.
        </p>
            
        <p>Searching for the body that we grasp - it would exist amongst its parts or outside its parts. There is no third possibility.
        If a part of our body was our body then we would have many bodies. The body is the part-possessor.
        </p>

        <p>
        The collection of the parts of our body cannot be the body. A Collection of parts cannot magically transform into the part possessor - the body.
        If we could find the body as the collection of its parts - then we could remove all its parts and be left with the body.
        </p>

        <p>
        This non-existence of the body that we normally see is the emptiness of our body - the true nature of our body.
        </p>

        <p>
        It is perhaps less confusing to simply say that for a mind that directly sees the truth, emptiness, there is no body. A body exists only for an ordinary mind to which a body appears.
        </p>

        </section>
        <section title="The Emptiness of our Mind">
            <p>
                Our mind is a continuum that depeneds on many factors. E.g. our primary mind is merely imputed upon its basis of imputation - its five mental factors.
            </p>
        <p>
        All phenomena that appear to my mind are the nature of my mind and my mind is the nature of emptiness.
        </p>
        <p>
        This way of meditating on emptiness is more profound then the meditation on the emptiness of our body.
        </p>
        </section>
        <section title="The Emptiness of our I">

        If the I exists in the way it appears then it must exist as one of four possibilities:

        <list>
            <item>as the body</item>
            <item>as the mind</item>
            <item>as the collection of the body and mind</item>
            <item>or as something separate from the our body and mind.</item>
        </list>

        In truth, our self and other phenomena that exist as mere imputation is the ultimate nature of our self and other phenomena, not the conventional nature.

        </section>
        <section title="Conventional and Ultimate Truths">
        <p>
            Whatever exists is either a conventional truth or an ultimate truth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conventional truths ar false objects because the way they appear and the way they exist do not correspond.
        </p>
            Although conventional truths are false, they do exist because they are realised by a valid mind.
            <list>
                <item>Gross conventional truths. Dependence on parts, causes, basis of imputation.</item>
                <item>Subtle conventional truths. Existing merely as imputation by thought.</item>
            </list>
        <p>
            Strictly speaking, truth, ultimate truth and emptiness are synonyms because conventional truths are not real truths but false objects.
        </p>

            <p>When we have realised the mere absence of the eight extremes then we have realised the emptiness of all
                phenomena.
            </p>


            <p>The meditation on the emptiness of produced phenomena(our self who was born in dependence of causes and
                conditions.. ) is called space-like meditative equipoise on emptiness.
            </p>


            If we are successful then during our meditation we are free from manifest self-grapsing.

                The initial realization of great bliss is the path of seeing of highest yoga tantra - having the power to eliminate both innate and intellectually formed delusions.
                The practitioner arising from this meditation has attained liberation. (Compared to a superior bodhisattva on the path of seeing.)
