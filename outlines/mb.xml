                Dissolution of the 7 winds. The first 4 winds are gross and the last 3 are subtle.
                A sign appears after the dissolution of each wind. There are 3 levels of dissolution: slight, almost completely and completely. The greater the dissolution - the clearer the appearance of the sign of dissolution.

                    <type>The fire wind element supports the heat in our body. The sign that the fire wind has dissolved is the sparkling fire-flies like appearance.</type>

            <section>The very subtle wind (continually residing wind) is the very subtle body, which transforms into the vajra body - the pure illusory body which has definite shape and color. For example the vajra body will look like Heruka with twelve arms. The pure illusory body transforms into the form body of a Buddha and the union of bliss and emptiness transforms into the truth body.

                <div>With this bliss, attachment is a cause to be released from samsara. Before we have this bliss - attachment causes us to be reborn in samsara.</div>

                The initial realization of great bliss is the path of seeing of highest yoga tantra - having the power to eliminate both innate and intellectually formed delusions.
                The practitioner arising from this meditation has attained liberation. (Compared to a superior bodhisattva on the path of seeing.)
