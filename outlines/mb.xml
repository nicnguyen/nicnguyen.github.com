        <section title="What is Emptiness?">
            Emptiness is the way things really are. It is the way things exist as opposed the the way they appear.
        </section>


        <section title="The Emptiness of our Body">
        <p>
        There are two ways of searching for an object - conventional search and ultimate search.
        </p>
            
        <p>
        Searching for the body that we grasp - it must exist amongst its parts or outside its parts. There is no third possibility.
        If a part of our body was our body then we would have many bodies. The body is the part-possessor.
        </p>

        <p>
        The collection of the parts of our body cannot be the body. A Collection of parts cannot magically transform into the part possessor - the body.
        If we could find the body as the collection of its parts - then we could remove all its parts and be left with the body.
        </p>

        <p>
        This non-existence of the body that we normally see is the emptiness of our body - the true nature of our body.
        </p>

        <p>
        It is perhaps less confusing to simply say that for a mind that directly sees the truth, emptiness, there is no body. A body exists only for an ordinary mind to which a body appears.
        </p>

        </section>
        <section title="The Emptiness of our Mind">
            <p>
                Our mind is a continuum that is merely imputed upon a collection of many factors - e.g. our primary mind has five parts - its five all-accompanying mental factors.
            </p>
        <p>
        All phenomena that appear to my mind are the nature of my mind and my mind is the nature of emptiness.
        </p>
        <p>
        This way of meditating on emptiness is more profound then the meditation on the emptiness of our body.
        </p>
        </section>
        <section title="The Emptiness of our I">

        If the I exists in the way it appears then it must exist as one of four possibilities:

        <list>
            <item>as the body</item>
            <item>as the mind</item>
            <item>as the collection of the body and mind</item>
            <item>or as something separate from the our body and mind.</item>
        </list>

        In truth, our self and other phenomena that exist as mere imputation is the ultimate nature of our self and other phenomena, not the conventional nature.

        <section title="Conventional and Ultimate Truths">
        <p>
            Whatever exists is either a conventional truth or an ultimate truth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conventional truths are false objects because the way they appear and the way they exist do not correspond.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although conventional truths are false, they do exist because they are realised by a valid mind.
        </p>
            <p>
            Conventional truths can be divided into:
            <list>
                <item>Gross conventional truths - depend upon their parts, causes, basis of imputation.</item>
                <item>Subtle conventional truths - existing merely as imputation by thought.</item>
            </list>
            </p>
        <p>
            Strictly speaking, truth, ultimate truth and emptiness are synonyms because conventional truths are not real truths but false objects.
        </p>

            <p>When we have realised the mere absence of the eight extremes then we have realised the emptiness of all
                phenomena.
            </p>


            <p>The meditation on the emptiness of produced phenomena(our self who was born in dependence of causes and
                conditions.. ) is called space-like meditative equipoise on emptiness.
            </p>


            If we are successful then during our meditation we are free from manifest self-grapsing.
        </section>
        <section title="The Union of the Two Truths">

        <definition>
            The union of the two truths means that the conventional truths such as our body and ultimate truths such as the emptiness of our body are the same nature
        </definition>
        <p>
            When our body appears to us we see both our body and the inherently existent body simultaneously. This is dualistic appearance which is subtle mistaken appearance.
        </p>

        There are two principal benefits of understanding that all emptinesses are the same nature:
        <list>
            <item>In the meditation session our mind will mix with emptiness more easily.</item>
            <item>In the meditation break we shall be able to see all appearances as equal manifestations of their emptiness.</item>
        </list>

        <p>The emptiness of the body, mind and I are the same nature and are distinguishable only by their conventional bases.</p>

        <p>For a qualified meditator single-pointedely absorbed in emptiness there is no difference between production/disintegration, impermanence/permanence, going/coming, singualrity/plurality.
        This realisation is called the yoga or equalizing samsara and nirvana.
        </p>


        </section>



        <section title="The Practice of Emptiness in our Daily Activities">
            <p>When we are familiar with emptiness the very fact that things appear clearly will remind us that they are not inherently existent.
            Knowing that whatever appears to our mind is mere appearance, when attractive objects appear we shall not grasp at them and develop attachment, and when unattractive objects appear we shall not grasp at them and develop aversion.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since our self grasping keeps us bound to samsara and is the source of all our problems, meditation on emptiness is the universal solution to all our problems.
